The Space Life Sciences Training Program (SLSTP) enables 10 college students a year to join us on the NASA Ames where they can get hands-on, real world experience working on scientific investigations. Each summer, junior and senior college students solicit research partners, work with mentors, and design a personal research project to explore over a 10-week period.  Please note: SLSTP study opportunities are available to US citizens, only.",
